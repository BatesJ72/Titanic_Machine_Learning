# Titanic Data

This is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to determine how likely a person was to surive the Titanic. The model looks at various features - gender, deck assignment, age - and uses the random forest model to determine whether or not they surived. Interestingly - the deck a person's room was on was a bigger factor in determining survival than either gender or age!
